test output looks like

how are tests built
they really focus on each segment - some things rely on the knowledge of the content

run order?
check each partition
have tests for each partition type then a structual test
can reuse tests for header and footers.


API design

Node and test carries everything

testing header
	testing against ISXD spec
		5.1 x is this
		pass/fail
